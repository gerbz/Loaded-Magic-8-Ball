# Loaded Magic Eightball

	Needed!
	Some awesome new design

#### How it works
Having a tough time convincing someone to go with your recommendation?  Rock, paper, scissors and coin flips are for n00bs.  Everyone trusts the Magic 8 Ball, but should they...

Shake the Loaded Magic 8 Ball for more than 3 seconds to get a yes, less than 3 seconds for a no.  Maybe's will happen... maybe.
